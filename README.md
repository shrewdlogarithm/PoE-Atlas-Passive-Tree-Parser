# PoE Atlas Passive Tree Parser

This is just an example to show how to parse the 'string' GGG use for the Atlas Passive Tree into the actual Node numbers 
 
 
aptest.js shows how to  parse the Atlas Passive Tree 'string' for a given account/league as a browser would (has CORS issues which would require fixing)

aptest.node.js is the same code as above but written so it works in Node (no CORS issues)

aptest.py is the code converted into Python (for a project let to come!)

atlas-skill-tree3_17.json is the GGG Atlas Passive database keyed by Node number with information on name/what it does/what it links-to etc.
